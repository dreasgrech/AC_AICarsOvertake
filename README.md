My main objective with this Assetto Corsa app is to force the AI traffic on the Nordschleife to only move to the right when other cars want to overtake them.

This is because I want to recreate the true **Nordschleife Touristenfahrten** experience where by law you are required to overtake only on the left and thus yielding cars always need yield to the right.

Currently a work in progress but it's already showing positive, working results.  Once the yielding to the right functionality is solid, I'll expand the app to allow for both right AND left yielding so it can be used for street road tracks in other countries.
